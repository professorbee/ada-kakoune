# Ada mode for Kakoune

This plugin provides syntax highlighting and some auto-indentation
for Ada in Kakoune.

To install, chuck the file in your autoload folder.

Hopefully you find this useful.  Feel free to open an issue if you
encounter any problems.

## Updates

At the time of writing, I'm not using Kakoune anymore, so I probably
won't update this unless an issue is opened. 

That said, please do ping me if you rely on this and a Kakoune update
broke it. Ada is all about reliability, after all. ðŸ™ƒ
